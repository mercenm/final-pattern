# Stadistical Patter Recognition Proyect.

## Abstract
The purpose of this work is to find classification and predictive statistical models. This model should help us find the answer to questions postulated about the dataset of MiBici, a public bicycle system in Guadalajara, Mexico. The service is based on bicycle rental in different stations, offered every day of the year.

The orientation of the work is on differences in gender and age bicycle usage. The data provided is natural, making the results of some questions not great and others regular. In the end, we concluded that depending on the category, the user's gender makes a difference.
