## Abstract.
The purpose of this work is to find classification and predictive statistical models. This model should help us find the answer to questions postulated about the dataset of MiBici, a public bicycle system in Guadalajara, Mexico. The service is based on bicycle rental in different stations, offered every day of the year.

The orientation of the work is on differences in gender and age bicycle usage. The data provided is natural, making the results of some questions not great and others regular. In the end, we concluded that depending on the category, the user's gender makes a difference. 


## Introduction.
The green movement is taking root with the bicycle loan system implementation in many localities by the government of some states in Mexico, resulting in an increase in bicycle mobility and fulfilling the purpose of discouraging the usage of automobiles as a source of transport. 

There are four public bicycle systems in Mexico. Mexico City is the pioneer in implementing ECOBICI, which started in February 2010. Guadalajara followed with the sustainable system MiBici in December 2014. Subsequently, adding to these two was Toluca with Huizi in November 2015 and, in February of last year, Pachuca with Bici Capital, an innovative hybrid bicycle system.

Although at a slower pace, in the Metropolitan zone of Guadalajara, the proposed public bicycle MiBici, as part of the citizen transportation system, is the second largest in the country and has accomplished more than 450 thousand rides.

Considering the vehicular saturation reached in Guadalajara, the bicycle system acceptance has been favorable. According to a survey by the Mobility and Transportation Institut of Jalisco, in a year of operations of MiBici, of the users who migrated to this modality, 52% were public transport users, 22% were traveling by car, 12% moved in their bicycle, 11% walked and 3% used cabs. 

In this work, we will be using the public dataset for MiBici. We will begin with an exploratory analysis, followed by a problem statement and some answers to the proposed questions for the aggregation and prediction methods, finishing with some conclusions.
